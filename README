for statistical purposes. It could be used for software that monitors
the system for alerting or graphing purposes.

the tools and examples are licensed under the GNU GPL.

Building and Installation
-------------------------

After downloading and extracting libstatgrab, configure and build as
follows;

./configure
make

Then install as root;

make install

There are, of course, the usual GNU-style configure options;

  --prefix=PREFIX

For more documentation on the installation process, please read the
INSTALL document.

Cygwin Notes
------------

If you have installed libncurses-devel but the configure script can't
find ncurses.h, you've most likely hit a bug in the cygwin package. To
fix this run: /etc/postinstall/libncurses-devel.sh.done
