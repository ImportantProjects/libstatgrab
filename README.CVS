Starting from CVS there are a few things that need to be done before
the normal build procedure. These require autoconf, automake, and
libtool to be installed.

Then run the following;

aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
libtoolize -c
automake -a -c

After this the normal build procedure in the README file can be
followed.
