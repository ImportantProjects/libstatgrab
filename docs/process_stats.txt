Process Statistics
==================

$Id$

Data Structure
--------------

The function returns a structure of type process_stat_t that looks
like this:

typedef struct{
        int total;
        int running;
        int sleeping;
        int stopped;
        int zombie;
}process_stat_t;

total		is the total number of processes
running		is the number of running processes
sleeping	is the number of sleeping processes
stopped		is the number of stopped processes
zombie		is the number of zombie processes

Functions
---------

process_stat_t *get_process_stats();

get_process_stats returns a static buffer process_stat_t.

It returns information on the number of processes on the system and
the different states they're in.

Examples
--------

See examples/process_stats.c for a working implementation.
