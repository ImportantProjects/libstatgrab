get_process_stats returns information on the number of processes on
the host, and the number in different states. It takes no arguments.

get_process_stats returns a static buffer process_stat_t

process_stat_t *get_process_stats();

typedef struct{
        int total;
        int running;
        int sleeping;
        int stopped;
        int zombie;
}process_stat_t;

total : stores the total number of processes on the machine
running : the number of running processes
sleeping : number of sleeping processes
stopped : number of stopped processes 
zombie : number of zombie processes

see examples/process_stats.c for a working implimentation.
