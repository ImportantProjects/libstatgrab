Memory stats are accessed through get_memory_stats() call. This 
returns a pointer to a static mem_stat_t 

typedef struct{
        long long total;
        long long free;
        long long used;
        long long cache;
}mem_stat_t;

total contains the total memory in bytes. 
free is the total free memory in bytes.
used is the total used memory in bytes.
cache is the cache used in bytes.

cache is not available in all operating systems. Solaris being a key
one that it isn't. free memory and cache memory can sometimes be 
linked.

Swap stats are accessed through get_swap_stats() call. This returns a
pointer to a static swap_stat_t

typedef struct{
        long long total;
        long long used;
        long long free;
}swap_stat_t;


Freebsd requires kmem privilages to be able to do this call. Making the 
program setgid kmem should be sufficent. 

TODO
Add a function to hold open the FD to kmem privilages could be dropped.
