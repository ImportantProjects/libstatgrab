page_stat_t *get_page_stats();
page_stat_t *get_page_stats_diff();

typedef struct{
        long long pages_pagein;
        long long pages_pageout;
        time_t systime;
}page_stat_t;

pages_pagein is the number of pages swapped into memory
pages_pageout is the number of pages swapped from memory to swap

get_page_stats() and get_page_stats_diff() both 
return a pointer to a static buffer of type page_stat_t

get_page_stats() will return the number of pages the system
has paged in and out since bootup. get_page_stats_diff() 
will return the difference since last time it was called.
If it has not been called before, it will return get_page_stats()

BUGS
Solaris doesn't seem to report accurately. It reports the number
of pages swapped into memory, not necessarily from swap. This 
feature isn't deamed entirely reliable :)
