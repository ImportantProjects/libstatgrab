Load stats a way of pulling out the load average of a system. On most systems, its
just a wrapper to getloadavg.

The call returns a static buffer of load_stat_t load_stat

load_stat_t is made up :

typedef struct{
        double min1;
        double min5;
        double min15;
}load_stat_t;

minX contains a double of the load average over the time X in minutes.
